# 👋 Hello!


My name is Hudson Smith and I am a developer that likes linux, bash, and python.

I have been programming for a long time.


# 📦 Code, Code, Code

Here are some cool projects of mine:

  Link: [Doom Neovim](https://github.com/hudsonsmith/doom-neovim)
  
  Doom Neovim is my own custom flavor of Neovim that I use on a daily basis.
  
  Since it is mine, I will update it for everybody, whenever I get a new feature, you will get it too.

  ### Features
  - Minimalistic looks inspired by modern IDEs.
  - Sane defaults for insane people.
  - Modern Git support.
  - FZF support.
  - Better start screen with Dashboard-nvim
  - Custom made statusline made specifically for Doom Neovim.
  - Better git commit that shows git diffs in a vertical split.
